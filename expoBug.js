This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI is unable to find or access the necessary Android SDK components.  It might happen due to incorrect SDK paths, missing dependencies, or permission issues. Let's say you're trying to build an Android APK and receive this error.  The code itself might be perfectly fine; the problem lies outside the application code within the Expo CLI's environment setup.
