The issue isn't directly fixable with code changes in `expoBugSolution.js` because it's an environment problem, not a code problem.  However, the solutions listed in the README would be implemented outside of the code, such as checking Android SDK paths, ensuring proper permissions, or updating the Expo CLI.  This example uses a simple Expo app just to show that the bug is not within the app's code:

```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>
      <StatusBar style="auto" />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});
```

The solutions are environment fixes rather than code modifications.
