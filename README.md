# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Android SDK Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android projects with the Expo CLI: failures related to the Android SDK. The problem is not within the application's code but rather with the environment's setup and configuration of the Android SDK. 

The `expoBug.js` file contains a basic Expo app (it's functional; the error isn't in the application code). The `expoBugSolution.js` provides solutions for debugging and fixing the SDK issues.

## Solutions

1. **Verify SDK Installation and Configuration:**  Ensure the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured. This involves checking the environment variables (ANDROID_HOME, JAVA_HOME), confirming that the SDK manager has downloaded all necessary components, and ensuring that the paths are accurate.

2. **Check for Permissions:** If you're using a Linux system, ensure you have appropriate permissions to access the Android SDK directories.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean build can resolve the issue. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `android` folder within your Expo project and reinstall dependencies.

4. **Update Expo CLI:** It's always best to make sure the Expo CLI is up to date: `expo upgrade`

5. **Restart your computer:** This is a classic troubleshooting step that frequently resolves seemingly intractable issues.

This repository serves as a guide and a reference point for developers encountering this type of build error.  The core message is that the error usually stems from environment setup and not necessarily flaws in the application's code.
